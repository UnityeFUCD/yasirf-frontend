            changes, hero talents, builds, and more. Hope we find this article

            WoW Demonology Warlock DPS is an adaptable spec who can summon waves
            of minions fighting on your side while you generate resources in
            between. This specialization has an efficient and fast operation
            once the learning curve is overcome. Demonology Warlocks are
            especially strong in encounters that have stable mobility rather
            than helter-skelter movement.
            <br />
            <br /> One significant advantage of Demonology spec is that they
            bring Demonic Gateway that can transport your entire group 40 yards
            forward.
            <br />
            <br /> Demonology Warlock in WoW presents itself as the numerically
            better Warlock specialization, offering competitive single target
            and AoE with a new tier set offering a fun optimization angle in
            multitarget while retaining the spec flavor. The rework has been
            successful at what it intended to accomplish, as the spec is now in
            a healthier state in terms of both the damage profile and the
            resources flow, having essentially eliminated the extreme but niche
            cases where resources could be pooled for very remarkable burst
            occasions.
